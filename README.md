## Hello, I'm Jocelyn!
I'm a second year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I'm currently looking for summer internships in software and firmware development. Let me tell you a little bit out me:

- I'm partcipating in research in microarchitecture with Professor Tor Aamodt and Dival Shah through the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia.
- I'm currently programming an AI generated newsletter that combines different forms of media from around the internet to provide interesting media in a variety of subjects.
- I am super passionate about the ocean and participated in Ocean Wise's Oceanbridge Ambassador program where I engaged in 150+ hours of community service to protect the oceans.
- I am on the electrical team of SUBC, UBC's Submarine Design Team that participated in the International Submarine Races 2023 and currently preparing for the European International Submarine Races 2024.
- I run an Instagram account with 18k+ followers documenting my life as a women in STEM.

Please feel free to reach out, I would love to get to know you too!
