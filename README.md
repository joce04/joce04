## Hello, I'm Jocelyn!
I'm a second year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia. I'm currently looking for summer internships in software and firmware development. Let me tell you a little bit out me:

- I'm currently programming an AI generated newsletter that combines different forms of media from around the internet to provide interesting media in a variety of subjects.
- I am super passionate about the ocean and participated in Ocean Wise's Oceanbridge Ambassador program where I engaged in 150+ hours of community service to protect the oceans.
- I am on the electrical team of SUBC, UBC's Submarine Design Team that participated in the International Submarine Races 2023 and currently preparing for the European International Submarine Races 2024.
- I run an Instagram account with 18k+ followers documenting my life as a women in STEM.
- I'm partcipating in research in microarchitecture with Professor Tor Aamodt and Dival Shah through the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia.

Please feel free to reach out, I would love to get to know you too!
