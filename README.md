## Hello, I'm Jocelyn!
I'm a third-year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia. It's nice to meet you! Let me tell you a little bit about me:

- I'm participating in research in microarchitecture with Professor Tor Aamodt and Deval Shah through the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia.
- I'm currently programming an AI-generated newsletter combining different media forms from around the internet to provide interesting media on various subjects.
- I am super passionate about the ocean and participated in Ocean Wise's Oceanbridge Ambassador program, where I engaged in 150+ hours of community service to protect the oceans.
- Sustainability, conservation, healing the earth are all subjects that I'm interested in!
- I am on the electrical team of SUBC, UBC's Submarine Design Team that participated in the International Submarine Races 2023 and is currently preparing for the European International Submarine Races 2024.
- I run an Instagram account with 22k+ followers documenting my life as a woman in STEM and my various projects.

Please feel free to reach out. I would love to get to know you, too!
